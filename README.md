The work of both Task Framework and the generic resource management framework are managed by a single, central scheduler: Helix Controller.
That means that a single Controller runs in one JVM with no isolation, and we cannot prevent a slowdown in resource management from affecting 
assigning and scheduling of tasks, and vice versa. In other words, there is a resource competition between the two entities. 
In this sense, we need to separate one Helix Controller into two separate Controllers running independentlyâ€”a Helix Controller and a Task Framework Controller.
